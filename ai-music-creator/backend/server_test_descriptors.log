🚀 Features: Professional Instrument AI generation, Spotify training, Multi-genre support
🎵 Enhanced detection: Single instrument + descriptor -> isolated generation
🎵 Detected enhanced isolated request: "heavy bass" -> bass {
  energy: 0.9,
  dynamics: 0.95,
  rhythm: 'driving',
  texture: 'thick',
  descriptors: [ 'heavy', 'heavy', 'heavy', 'heavy' ]
}
🎵 Isolated instrument request detected: bass
🎵 Generating isolated bass track with styles: [ 'heavy', 'heavy', 'heavy', 'heavy' ]
🎵 Using enhanced style analysis for bass: [ 'heavy', 'heavy', 'heavy', 'heavy' ]
🎵 Enhanced generation for bass: {
  originalTempo: 120,
  adjustedTempo: 144,
  energy: '0.90',
  groove: '0.90',
  descriptors: [ 'heavy', 'heavy', 'heavy', 'heavy' ]
}
🎸 Generating bass with style-responsive modeling...
🎸 Bass style analysis: energy=0.90, dynamics=0.95, rhythm=driving, texture=thick
🎸 Bass descriptors: [heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy]
🎸 HEAVY BASS: Deep, powerful, sustained pattern
🎸 Bass generation: pattern=heavy_sustained, amplitude=0.95, attack=0.001s, sustain=0.9, notes/beat=1
💾 Saved isolated bass pattern to Professional Instrument AI model
✅ Isolated bass generation completed: isolated-bass.wav
🎵 Enhanced detection: Single instrument + descriptor -> isolated generation
🎵 Detected enhanced isolated request: "upbeat bass" -> bass {
  energy: 0.7,
  dynamics: 0.6,
  rhythm: 'straight',
  texture: 'clean',
  descriptors: [ 'upbeat' ]
}
🎵 Isolated instrument request detected: bass
🎵 Generating isolated bass track with styles: [ 'upbeat' ]
🎵 Using enhanced style analysis for bass: [ 'upbeat' ]
